name: weekly-meal-planner
description: >-
  Plan a week of meals around the staples someone already keeps on hand. Produces
  an editable N-day plan (default 5 cooking nights + 2 flex days for leftovers or
  eating out), a grocery list grouped by store section, prep/cook notes with
  thaw/make-ahead timing, and short recipes. Optionally estimates per-plate
  calories and macros for a "primary eater" when targets are provided. Use when
  the user wants to map out weekly meals, build a meal plan, plan dinners for the
  week, or organize a grocery run. Reads a preferences file if present; otherwise
  asks a few short questions first.

# Weekly Meal Planner

Turn a household's staples and a week's constraints into a concrete, cookable plan.
The output is meant to be *edited* — treat every plan as a first draft the user will
push back on (especially on portions and counts).

## 0. Load context before planning

1. **Look for a preferences file.** Check the conversation/project for `preferences.md`
   (or ask the user to paste theirs). It defines household size, meals to plan,
   dietary rules, staples, stores, and optional macro targets. The template is
   `preferences.example.md` in this skill.
2. **If no preferences exist, ask a short intake** — don't guess these:
   - How many cooking nights this week, and how many flex days (leftovers / eating out)? *(default: 5 + 2)*
   - Who's eating? (# adults, # kids; is it one batch for the whole table?)
   - Any allergies, dislikes, or "never serve" foods?
   - What staples/proteins do you want to build around this week? Any groceries already on hand?
   - Which meals do you want planned — just dinners, or breakfast/lunch/snacks too?
   - Do you want per-plate calories/macros? If so, for whom and what are the targets?
   - Primary grocery store(s)?
   Keep intake to one message. Fill sensible defaults for anything they skip and say so.
3. **Ask what's already in the house** if they didn't say. Plans should *use up* what's
   on hand before adding to the shopping list.

## 1. Draft the plan

Read `references/output-format.md` for the exact layout. Core rules:

- **Plan around their staples and a small rotation**, not novelty. Adherence beats variety.
- **One dish per night that feeds the whole table.** No separate kids' meals unless the
  preferences say so; keep heat/spice out of the main batch and offer it at the table.
- **Match effort to the day.** Default to simple, one-pan, ~20–30 min unless told otherwise.
- **Honor the cooking style** in preferences (cuisines, cookbooks, time budget).
- **Get counts and portions right — this is where plans fail.** If someone says "2 packs
  of 4 patties," that's 8, not 4. State your count math explicitly (`8 patties → table
  uses 5 → 3 leftover`) so the user can catch an error fast. When unsure of pack sizes,
  ask rather than assume.

## 2. Portions, macros, and leftovers

- **Separate "the table" from "the primary eater."** Give family-scale quantities for the
  cook, and a specific plate + (optional) macros for the primary eater.
- **Macros are optional.** Only include them if preferences provide targets. When you do,
  use the format in `references/output-format.md`, and **flag the binding constraint**
  (the macro the user runs out of first — e.g. fat) rather than every number. Mark
  confidence on estimates; defer to the user's own logged actuals if they share them.
- **Estimate leftovers and route them.** For each night, say roughly how much is left and
  where it goes (next-day lunches, a second dinner, freeze). This is a headline feature —
  don't skip it. See `references/satiety-and-adherence.md`.
- **Never re-flag a portion the user has already set.** If they corrected you or locked a
  portion earlier, keep it.

## 3. Grocery list

- Group by **store section** (produce, meat/seafood, dairy, dry goods, frozen, etc.) so it's
  walkable. Template: `templates/grocery-list-template.md`.
- **Split "already have" vs "need to buy."** Only shop the gap.
- **Flag anything the plan needs that isn't on hand or on a provided receipt**, and offer a
  substitute (e.g. "no feta listed — grab a block, or shave parmesan instead").
- If preferences name a primary + supplemental store, note which items belong to each.

## 4. Prep & cook notes

- **Thaw/defrost reminders** the day before (e.g. "pull shrimp to the fridge tomorrow AM").
- **Batch-cook and make-ahead** moves that save a weeknight.
- **Sequence for the table time** if the user gives one (e.g. "on the table by 5:30" → when
  to start each night).

## 5. Offer, don't assume, the automations

After the plan is approved, *offer* optional follow-ups — never do them unprompted:
- Set calendar invites for each cook night (timed to be done by the target dinner time).
- Set reminders with the meal + portions in the title.
These depend on the user's own tools/integrations. Keep titles specific ("Cook: pork chops
+ fennel, start 4:50") and put full recipe/macros in the notes. Only touch the user's
calendar/reminders with explicit go-ahead.

## 6. Iterate

Expect edits. When the user corrects counts, portions, or swaps a night, **recompute the
affected leftovers, macros, and grocery quantities** — don't just change the one line. Show
the count math again so the fix is verifiable.
